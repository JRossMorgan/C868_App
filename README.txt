To run the program, simply enter the log-in credentials and press the "Log In" button. This will take you to the main page where you will be able to navigate to the "Customers", "Appointments",
and "Contacts" pages. From the "Customers" page, you can add a customer or modify an existing customer. The "Appointments" page works in much the same way. The "Conmtacts" page generates a schedule
for the company contacts.

The additional report, found on the "Customers" page generates a report on the anniversaries of the customers in the database. There is even an alert that pops-up when it's happens to be a customer's
anniversary.
